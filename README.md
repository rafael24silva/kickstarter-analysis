# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise examine the different lauch dates and funding goals of other plays to compare to her own fundraising goal, which is close to being fulfilled, for her play titled *Fever*.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For this analysis, the first thing that was done was to create a pivot table with the outcome of all of the theater projects summarized by month. With this data we created a line chart that tracks how many of each outcome happened throughout each month. This chart will be posted in the Resources folder and will also be shared in this file. The pivot table has also been posted.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
We have also created another sheet that summarizes the number of successful, failed, and canceled plays by their goal amount. Using the countifs function, we were able to summarize each category by percentage. We then created another line chart that evaluates the correlation between the goal amount and the percentage of each play that succeeded, failed, or was canceled. The table and summary statistics will be posted below.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There were not many challenges that can be taken from this analysis. There may be some difficulty in knowing how to properly format the pivot table or getting the countifs function in excel to work properly. All of the other tasks to successfully complete this project should not be too difficult. Both line charts were fairly easy to create.

## Results

- We can conclude that between March and May, there is a constant increase in the amount of successful campaigns, while the amount of failed campaigns stays fairly the same. From June to December there is a decline in the amount of successful campaigns. There is also a small increase between September and November in failed campaigns. The amount of canceled projects stays faily the same throughout the whole year with the exception of October where there are no canceled projects.

- The highest chances of success are when the goal amount is $5,000 or lower. There is also a good chance of succeeding when the amount is between $35,000 to $45,000, this may need further analysis though. For the most part, the higher the goal, the less chances of succeeding , with the exception of that $35,000 to $45,000 range.

- For the first analysis of our launch dates, instead of just using the play subcategory, all of the subcategories under theather were used. There may be a possibilty of bias or exaggerated results due to this addition. The data for this analysis also uses many years, it is possible that going further back in time may also bias the analysis because it may not completely take into account modern trends. We also did not include the amount of pledged dollars, which could give us a bigger picture.

- Other graphs and tables that could of been used include bar graphs and a box and whisker plot. With the box and whisker plot, we could have created a pivot table and with specific data, we could have calculated the standard deviation to see how much our data varies.
